# Py data-faker

This is an adaptation of [dunnhumby's data-faker](https://github.com/dunnhumby/data-faker) in PySpark. It aims to not only translate all original functionality, but also to modernize it in the process.

In the future, this will have proper documentation. As of now this is very much a work in progress.
